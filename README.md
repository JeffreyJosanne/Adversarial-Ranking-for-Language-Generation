# SeqGAN-PyTorch
A implementation of SeqGAN in PyTorch, following the implementation in tensorflow.


## Requirements: 
* **PyTorch v0.1.12**
* Python 2.7
* CUDA 7.5+ (For GPU)

## Origin
The idea is from paper [SeqGAN: Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05473.pdf)

The code is rewrited in PyTorch with the structure largely from [Tensorflow Implementation](https://github.com/LantaoYu/SeqGAN)

## Runing
```
$ python main.py
```
After runing this file, the results will be printed on terminal. You can change the parameters in the ```main.py```.
